/*I'm sure you're familiar with factorials â€“ that is, the product of an integer and all the integers below it.

For example, 5! = 120, as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

Your challenge is to create a function that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of. So, if your function receives 120, it should return "5!" (as a string).

Of course, not every number is a factorial of another. In this case, your function would return "None" (as a string).

Examples
120 will return "5!"
24 will return "4!"
150 will return "None"

function reverseFactorial(num) {
	let sum = 1;
	for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
		sum *= i;
		if (sum === num) {
			return `${i.toString()}!`;
		}
	}
	return 'None';
}

console.log(reverseFactorial(120)); //, '5!');
console.log(reverseFactorial(3628800)); //, '10!');
console.log(reverseFactorial(150)); //, 'None');
