# codewars

Codewars is a platform to build problem solving skills in multiple programming languages.

By completing challenges called 'katas', users earn points and increase their ranking.

Challenges starting at 8kyu are the easiest, and they go down to 1kyu which is the hardest.

I generally solve katas at 7kyu or 6kyu, occasionally at 5kyu.

These levels are equivalent to Easy or Medium challenges on LeetCode.

I created this repo to track my progress and write cleaner, more efficient & readable code.
